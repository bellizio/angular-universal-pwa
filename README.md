# Angular Universal PWA Starter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Build the universal app

Run `npm run build:ssr` to build the universal app for production purposes. See the [Angular Universal Docs](https://angular.io/guide/universal) for more information.

## Serve the universal app

Run `npm run serve:ssr` to serve the production app locally. **NOTE**: `npm run build:ssr` must be run prior to running the serve command.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Service Worker

By default, the production build uses a service worker generated by NGSW ([Angular Service Worker](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-getting-started)).

To use a service worker generated by the [Workbox CLI](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli), do the following:

1.  In app.browser.module.ts, comment out the call to `ServiceWorkerModule.register()` and enable the call to `registerWorkboxSW()`
2.  Run `npm run build:ssr`
3.  Run `npm run sw:workbox`
